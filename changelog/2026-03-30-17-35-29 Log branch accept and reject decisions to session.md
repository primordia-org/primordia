# Move Accept/Reject from preview server to parent session page

## What changed

### `lib/local-evolve-sessions.ts`
- Added `'accepted'` and `'rejected'` to the `LocalSessionStatus` union type.
- After spawning the preview dev server, the process is tracked only via the local
  `devServerProcess` variable — no exported Map, no PID stored to SQLite.
- Fixed a pre-existing TypeScript `never` narrowing bug in the error handler: captured
  `devServerProcess` in a typed local const before the null-check, since TypeScript
  cannot track the `ChildProcess | null` type across async callback boundaries.
- When creating the worktree, the parent branch name is stored in git config as
  `branch.<name>.parent` (was already done) so the manage route can look it up.

### `app/api/evolve/local/manage/route.ts`
- Complete rewrite. The route now runs exclusively in the **parent** server (not the
  child preview server).
- The `GET` endpoint has been removed — it was only used by `AcceptRejectBar` to
  detect whether the running instance was a preview, which is no longer needed.
- `POST` now accepts `{ action: "accept" | "reject", sessionId: string }`.
- Session info (branch, worktreePath) is looked up from the parent's own SQLite DB
  using `sessionId` — no more reading git state from the child's working directory.
- The child dev server is killed by finding its process via `lsof -ti tcp:<port>` —
  one code path, no in-memory Map to check and no stored PID to fall back on.
- Accept/reject decisions are written directly to the parent's own SQLite database —
  no more opening the parent's `.primordia-auth.db` from a child process path.
- Removed the race condition where the child was responsible for deleting its own
  worktree and then immediately exiting.

### `lib/db/types.ts`
- Removed `devServerPid` from `EvolveSession` and from the `updateEvolveSession`
  parameter signature — the PID is no longer stored or read.

### `lib/db/sqlite.ts`
- Removed `dev_server_pid INTEGER` column from the `evolve_sessions` table schema
  and the associated `ALTER TABLE` migration.
- Removed `devServerPid` from `createEvolveSession`, `updateEvolveSession`,
  `getEvolveSession`, and `listEvolveSessions`.

### `components/EvolveSessionView.tsx`
- Added `"accepted"` and `"rejected"` to the `EvolveSessionData` status union and all
  terminal-status arrays (polling stop condition, initial poll skip).
- The **preview link** section now shows only the URL. The three decision actions
  (Accept, Reject, Follow-up) live in a unified card beneath it.
- After a successful accept, the component calls `POST /api/evolve/local/restart`
  directly (no more postMessage round-trip through the child window).
- Added informational banners: green "✅ Changes accepted" and red "🗑️ Changes
  rejected", shown once a decision has been recorded.
- The preview link and three-action card are hidden once status is `"accepted"` or
  `"rejected"`.
- **Redesigned decision UX**: the three choices — **Follow-up Changes**, **Accept
  Changes**, and **Reject Changes** — are presented under an **"Available Actions"**
  header in a flex row (each `flex-1`, no visual hierarchy favouring one over the
  others). Follow-up is listed first as the least destructive option.
- Each button is colour-coded by default (amber / green / red). Once any button is
  clicked, only the active tab retains its colour; the others dim to gray — making it
  immediately clear which panel is open without visual noise when nothing is selected.
- Each button behaves like a toggle: clicking it expands a confirmation/input panel
  beneath the row; clicking the same button again collapses the panel. Only one
  panel is open at a time.
  - **Follow-up panel**: shows the description text, a textarea that auto-focuses
    when the panel opens, and a **Submit follow-up** button.
  - **Accept panel**: names the preview branch and target branch, then shows a
    **Confirm** button that calls `handleAccept`.
  - **Reject panel**: names the preview branch, then shows a **Confirm** button that
    calls `handleReject`.
- Removed the "Do you wish to do that?" confirmation line from both the Accept and
  Reject panels — the branch names already provide sufficient context.
- Accept and Reject panels show an "unavailable" message (instead of a Confirm
  button) when `canAcceptReject` is false — i.e. when the session branch is not a
  direct child of the currently checked-out branch.
- Added `sessionBranch` prop (the preview branch name) so the confirmation copy can
  name the exact branch without waiting for the first poll response.
- `handleFollowupSubmit` no longer takes a `React.FormEvent` parameter — the
  follow-up is now triggered by a plain button `onClick` rather than a `<form>`
  `onSubmit`.

### `app/evolve/session/[id]/page.tsx`
- Replaced `isSessionBranchDescendantOfCurrent` (which used `git merge-base
  --is-ancestor`) with `isSessionBranchChildOfCurrent`, which reads
  `git config branch.<name>.parent` — the key written at worktree-creation time.
  This is simpler and more direct: no git-graph traversal, just a config lookup.
- Computes `canAcceptReject` from the parent-branch check and passes it to
  `EvolveSessionView`. The value is `false` when the config key is absent or
  does not match the current branch.
- Passes `sessionBranch={session.branch}` to `EvolveSessionView` so the
  confirmation copy can name the preview branch without waiting for polling.

### `components/AcceptRejectBar.tsx` / `app/layout.tsx`
- `AcceptRejectBar` is no longer rendered in the root layout — child preview servers
  no longer show the "🔍 This is a local preview" bottom banner.
- The restart-on-accept listener (postMessage handler) has been removed from the
  layout; the session page now calls the restart API directly after accepting.

## Why

Previously, accepting or rejecting a branch was handled by the child (preview) dev
server: it would directly open the parent's SQLite file by path, write the outcome,
delete its own worktree, and call `process.exit()`. This caused several problems:

1. **Cross-process DB writes** — the child editing a SQLite file owned by another
   running process is fragile and technically a race condition.
2. **Self-deletion race** — the child process was deleting its own worktree and branch
   immediately before exiting, which could produce errors depending on timing.
3. **Confusing UX** — users had to open the preview tab and scroll down to find the
   accept/reject bar there, then return to the session page.

The new design keeps all git operations and DB writes in the parent server, which
owns the data. The child is a read-only preview; all decisions happen in the parent.

The preview dev server is killed by port (`lsof -ti tcp:<port>`) rather than by a
stored PID or an in-memory Map reference. This is the single, always-valid approach:
the process is always bound to its port while it is running, regardless of whether
the parent server restarted or the in-memory Map was reset. One code path — no
fallbacks that can silently bitrot.

The three choices a user can make — follow-up, accept, or reject — are presented as
equal-weight colour-coded buttons under an "Available Actions" header. Follow-up is
listed first as the least destructive option; accept and reject follow. When no action
is selected every button shows its accent colour (amber / green / red) so the choices
are immediately identifiable. Once a tab is opened the inactive buttons dim to gray,
reducing visual noise and drawing attention to the active panel. The redundant "Do you
wish to do that?" prompt has been removed — naming the exact branch being merged or
deleted already provides full context before the user clicks Confirm.

The accept/reject buttons are hidden unless the session branch is a direct child of the
current branch. The check reads `git config branch.<name>.parent`, which is written at
worktree-creation time. This is simpler than `git merge-base --is-ancestor`: no
git-graph traversal, just a key-value lookup. The original descendant check using
`merge-base` was unreliable in practice; the `branch.*.parent` config key is the most
direct way to answer "was this branch created from the branch I'm currently on?"
