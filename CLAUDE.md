## What Is Primordia?

Primordia is a self-modifying web application. Users land on a marketing page, then propose changes to the app by opening the hamburger (☰) menu and choosing "Propose a change" — or navigating directly to the `/evolve` page. Requests are automatically built as local git worktree previews, powered by the Claude Agent SDK. Users then accept or reject each preview.

The core idea: **the app becomes whatever its users need it to be**, with no coding or git knowledge required from users.

## Current Architecture

### Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | AI models write Next.js well |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | AI models write Tailwind well; no CSS files to manage |
| Language | TypeScript | Catches mistakes; Claude Code understands it well |
| AI API | Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) | Routes through exe.dev LLM gateway by default; users may override with their own Anthropic API key or Claude Code credentials.json (stored in localStorage/DB, encrypted in transit via one hybrid AES-GCM + RSA-OAEP envelope for all credential types) |
| Hosting | exe.dev | Production builds via `bun run build && bun run start`; single systemd service (`primordia-proxy`) manages both proxy and production app; blue/green slot swap on accept |
| Runtime versioning | mise (`mise.toml`) | Pins Bun per worktree; evolve setup trusts `mise.toml`, and the reverse proxy launches worktree servers with `mise exec -C <worktree>` |
| AI code gen | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` | `query()` runs Claude Code in git worktrees for evolve requests |
| Database | bun:sqlite | Local SQLite for passkey auth **and evolve session persistence**; same adapter on exe.dev and local dev |
| Package install security | Bun `minimumReleaseAge` + `@socketsecurity/bun-security-scanner` | New package resolutions must be at least 24 hours old and are scanned by Socket during `bun install` |

### File Map

Detailed annotations for each directory are in path-scoped rules files (`.claude/rules/filemap-*.md`) — Claude Code loads them automatically when you work in the relevant directory. The overview below covers root-level files and top-level directories.

## Environment Variables

These must be set in:
- **Local development**: `.env.local` (copy from `.env.example`)
- **exe.dev**: `.env.local` is created by `scripts/install.sh` during provisioning

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `REVERSE_PROXY_PORT` | Yes | Port the reverse proxy listens on (e.g. `3000`). Blue/green accepts and rollbacks use zero-downtime cutover via the proxy. |
| `PRIMORDIA_DIR` | No | Root directory of the Primordia installation. Set by the installer in the systemd service — not intended for manual configuration. Fresh installs: repo root. Worktree installs: two levels above the worktree (`$PRIMORDIA_DIR/worktrees/{branch}`). |
| `NEXT_BASE_PATH` | No | URL sub-path prefix (e.g. `/primordia`) for hosting the app at a non-root path. Leave unset to serve from `/` (default). Sets both Next.js `basePath` config and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` for client-side `fetch()` calls. Also set automatically on preview dev servers to `/preview/{sessionId}` when `REVERSE_PROXY_PORT` is active. |

## Design Principles for Claude Code

When implementing changes, follow these principles:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md first.** Understand the current architecture before making changes.
2. **Minimal changes.** Only modify what is necessary for the user's request.
3. **No clever magic.** Write code that is easy for another AI to read and modify later.
4. **Minimal dependencies.** Every new dependency is a future maintenance burden. Avoid them unless essential.
5. **TypeScript everywhere.** Explicit types make the codebase more navigable for AI models.
6. **Tailwind for styling.** Do not add CSS files or CSS-in-JS libraries.
7. **App Router conventions.** Follow Next.js App Router patterns: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`.
8. **Protected routes show a 403 page, not a redirect.** When a logged-in user visits a page they lack permission for, render `<ForbiddenPage>` in place of the normal page content. The 403 page must include: (a) a brief description of what the page does, (b) the full list of conditions required, (c) which conditions the user meets and doesn't meet, and (d) how they can gain access. Unauthenticated users (no session at all) may still be redirected to `/login` — that is a different case. Only use `redirect()` for the auth-absent case; use `<ForbiddenPage>` for the permission-absent case.
9. **Prefer Lucide for icons.** Use `lucide-react` for all icons. Do not reach for other icon libraries (heroicons, react-icons, etc.) unless a specific icon is unavailable in Lucide.
10. **Server-first page data.** Initial page content should be loaded in Server Components whenever possible, then passed into client components as props. Avoid `useEffect(...fetch...)` for data required to render the first meaningful page view; reserve client fetches for mutations, explicit refreshes, SSE/polling/live previews, and intentionally lazy details. See `docs/instant-page-data-loading-strategy.md`.
11. **Add exactly one changelog file per pull request.** After every set of changes, create a single new file in `changelog/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS Description of change.md` (UTC time, e.g. `2026-03-16-21-00-00 Fix login bug.md`). The filename is the short description; the file body is the full "what changed + why" detail in markdown. One PR = one changelog entry, even if the PR went through multiple iterations.

## Current Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Evolve mode | ✅ Live | "Propose a change" in the hamburger opens a draggable/dockable floating dialog; `/evolve` page also exists as standalone; before any evolve worktree is deleted, its `.primordia-session.ndjson` log is saved as a gzip archive under `PRIMORDIA_DIR/past-sessions` when present |
| Local evolve pipeline | ✅ Live | git worktree → Claude Agent SDK → local preview → accept/reject |
| Evolve follow-up requests | ✅ Live | Chain multiple Claude passes on the same branch; form appears when session is ready; draft text persists across refreshes per session |
| Explicit preview target selection | ✅ Live | Agents set the session preview panel route by running `bun run set-preview-url /route` after app file edits and before validation/changelog work; the session page renders the preview as soon as that structured `preview_path` event appears instead of waiting for the agent run to finish or relying on ambiguous final-message path parsing |
| File attachments in evolve | ✅ Live | Attach images/files to initial and follow-up requests; files are copied into `worktree/attachments/` so Claude can read and use them; the page picker highlights nearest `data-component` targets in blue and nearest `data-id` targets in green, includes both names/selectors in generated element markdown, and key preview/follow-up controls carry explicit picker names via `data-id` |
| Evolve draft persistence | ✅ Live | Initial request drafts in `/evolve` and the floating Propose-a-change dialog share a local timestamped draft; follow-up drafts are saved per session until submitted; drafts older than one year are garbage-collected |
| Multiple agent harnesses | ✅ Live | Evolve form lets users choose harness (claude-code, pi, or codex) and model; preferences persisted per-user in DB; all harnesses receive the Primordia progress-monitor prompt and can update the session progress panel through `bun run progress plan insert|replace` and `bun run progress step done|failed`; progress starts with `Make a plan`, supports weighted steps, one active current step, failure/repair insertion, and groups text/reasoning/tool-call details under the active step; completed agent sections keep rendering the progress panel for success/error/timeout/abort states, including early termination before tool calls; legacy TodoWrite/Pi task events still render as a fallback for older session logs; Codex exec JSON is normalized into structured tool/reasoning session events |
| Upstream changes indicator | ✅ Live | Session page shows how many commits the resolved parent branch is ahead of the session branch, with an "Apply Updates" button that merges prod updates, snapshots the prod DB via SQLite `VACUUM INTO`, and hot-swaps the preview server DB cleanly; new session parentage is stored in both legacy git config and branch-marker commit trailers, with a `/branches` per-user toggle for which source to use; branch-marker mode requires an actual marker commit and does not infer missing parentage |
| Git diff summary | ✅ Live | Session page shows a collapsible "Files changed" section (file names + +/- LOC) once the session is ready/accepted/rejected |
| Session from existing branch | ✅ Live | Branches page shows "+ session" next to branches with no active session; evolvers can attach the full AI preview pipeline to any pre-existing local branch; the current branch is shown with its descendant tree even when it is outside production ancestry |
| Upstream updates (/admin/updates) | ✅ Live | Admin-only; pull upstream Primordia changes from configured update sources; auto-scheduled fetches |
| exe.dev deploy | ✅ Live | One-command SSH deploy via `bun run deploy-to-exe.dev <server-name>` |
| Dark theme | ✅ Live | Default dark UI with Tailwind |
| Passkey authentication | ✅ Live | WebAuthn passkeys via /login; sessions stored in SQLite |
| Cross-device QR sign-in | ✅ Live | Laptop shows QR code; authenticated phone scans it and approves; laptop gets a session |
| Credentials management | ✅ Live | Account Settings includes unified Billing sources (`/settings`) and Presets (`/settings/presets`); users can connect Claude.ai credentials and ChatGPT subscription OAuth credentials, store API keys encrypted, and define evolve presets that bundle billing source + harness + model; evolve session ChatGPT auth failures render an inline re-login prompt that can reconnect the subscription without leaving the session page |
| RBAC (roles) | ✅ Live | Simple role system: `admin` (auto-granted to first user) and `can_evolve`; /admin page lets admin grant/revoke roles; protected pages show informative 403 instead of redirecting |
| Dependency security (/admin/dependencies-security) | ✅ Live | Admin-only; shows `bun audit` output, daily checks for high/critical vulnerabilities, notification bell alerts, and one-click evolve sessions to update vulnerable packages |
| Server logs (/admin/logs) | ✅ Live | Admin-only; live tail of production server stdout/stderr via SSE; routes through `/_proxy/prod/logs` in production |
| Proxy logs (/admin/proxy-logs) | ✅ Live | Admin-only; live tail of `journalctl -u primordia-proxy -f -n 100` via SSE |
| Deep rollback (/admin/rollback) | ✅ Live | Admin-only; lists all previous production slots from primordia.productionHistory in git config; "Roll back" button for each target; zero-downtime cutover via reverse proxy |
| Server health (/admin/server-health) | ✅ Live | Admin-only; disk and memory usage with visual bars; oldest non-prod worktree cleanup |
| Git mirror (/admin/git-mirror) | ✅ Live | Admin-only; every production deploy auto-pushes to `mirror` remote if it exists |
| Instance identity & social graph | ✅ Live | Each instance has a fixed UUID v7, editable name+description; serves `/.well-known/primordia.json` with self+peers+edges; `/api/instance/register` lets child instances POST to register; instances installed from another Primordia persist/infer that parent URL and retry registration on first server request; admin panel at `/admin/instance` |
| User event tracking | ✅ Live | `events` table in SQLite; `POST /api/events` (open, no auth); `GET /api/events` (admin); browser helper in `lib/events-client.ts`; admin viewer at `/admin/events` |
| Web push notifications | ✅ Live | SQLite-backed VAPID keys + per-user push subscriptions + category preferences; `/api/web-push/*` endpoints; service worker at `/primordia-sw.js`; `/settings/notifications` lets evolvers subscribe to Security Vulnerabilities and Primordia Updates; scheduled dependency audits/update fetches send actionable category notifications; developer test page at `/test-pages/web-push-test` can simulate both categories |
| Read-only git HTTP | ✅ Live | Clone/fetch via `git clone http[s]://<host>/api/git`; proxied through `git http-backend`; push permanently blocked (403) |
| OpenAPI spec | ✅ Live | Served at `/api/openapi`; generated on first request from `openapi-gen.config.json` |

## Changelog

> **Changelog entries are stored exclusively in `changelog/`** — never in this file.
> Each file is named `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS Description.md`; the filename is the short description and the body has the full what+why detail.
> **One PR = one changelog entry.** Do not create multiple changelog files for a single pull request — consolidate all changes into one entry.
> The `/changelog` page reads `changelog/` directly at runtime. Having each entry as a separate timestamped file prevents merge conflicts.
> Do **not** add changelog bullets here.
